					<p>The African Science Academy (ASA) is a new, girls-only Advanced Level school for maths and science.
                        Opened in August 2016 on the outskirts of Accra, Ghana, ASA is a “sixth-form”
                        college leading to globally respected Cambridge International A Levels.</p> <br><br>
					<p>ASA is a boarding school for young women with outstanding maths and science potential. We select
                        academically gifted students with a passion for maths and science. Students apply from across Africa
                        and are admitted after their senior secondary education in preparation for progression
                        to the best universities in Africa and around the world. ASA is a pathway to undergraduate
                        study and future careers in Engineering, Science,Computing and more.
                        Means-tested scholarships and bursaries are available to all students.</p>
					<p>The school’s vision is to be the leading school in Africa for gifted young scientists.
                        The many nationalities which make up the ASA community leads to a rich and diverse
                        cultural atmosphere, where maths, science and technology are delivered to young women
                        in an inclusive environment.</p>
